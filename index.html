        <p class="indiv3"><b>From Science Fiction to Reality: The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</b></br>This article is about the evolution of artificial intelligence.</br>
            It was not until the mid 1950s that artificial intelligence was considered a possible enhancement in technology.</br>
            British mathematician, Alan Turing, created a test where a computer can determine how a human would think.</br>
            During his time as a mathematician, many people criticized his idea of implementing artificial intelligence.</br>
            But artificial intelligence is now widely used in modern day technology.</br>
            The discovery of Artificial Intelligence has had a major impact in the workplace.</br>
            A lot of data is collected and organized using machine learning in the offices of many companies.</br>
            Overall, no one would have ever imagined that artificial intelligence would be a part of the real world.</br>


        <p class="indiv3">My response: I find it interesting that artificial intelligence seems to be popular not only in the tech world</br>
        but also in the business world. I believe that the use of Artificial intelligence can have its share of pros and cons.</br>
        Pros because it helps organize a companies’ data similar to the functions of a database. But cons because some forms of artificial</br>
        intelligence such as self-driving cars has caused tragedies in the death of one of the drivers of a self- driving car in recent news.</br>
        I think it is surprising that people criticized the Turing test because Alan Turing was a well-known mathematician so you would think that</br>
        his inventions would be credible.</p>

            3D printing is defined as a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.</br>
            Many companies as well as colleges and universities are investing in bringing 3D printing to their organizations.</br>
            3D printing has helped many companies complete successful projects and enhancing the production of their products</br>
            being sold. One publisher mentioned that he’s seeing an investment in 3D printing that he had never seen in the past.</br>
            Although 3D printing has been around for more than 25 years, it hasn’t been recognized until most recent years. The author </br>
            of the article believes that 3D printing is being spotlighted because of the arrival of desktop 3D printers. In addition, websites</br>
            like Kickstarter allows startup companies to launch their 3D printing based ideas on that platform which spreads more awareness about 3D printing.</br>
            One interesting fact is that 3D printing is often used in changing the design project workflow of animations such as the Avatar.</p>

        <p class="indiv3">
            My response: It is amazing how much 3D printing is evolving. I think it is great that it is being incorporated into colleges and universities so that college students can be exposed to the newest technology</br>
            and learn a new skill. It was surprising that 3D printing has been around for a while but is just now getting its recognition because many people rave at how interesting 3D printing is but I guess in the previous</br>
            years, it did not interest many people. The idea of using 3D printing for the production of new products is great for the success of a business. I found it very cool that many animations such as Avatar is created</br>
            by the use of 3D printing.</p>

        <p class="indiv3"><b>How Big Data Became So Big</b></br>The How Big Data Became So Big article focuses on how big data became extremely</br>
            popular. In March 2012, the Federal government had announced that $200 million would be invested in research on Big Data. Big Data can be </br>
            defined as applying the tools featured in artificial intelligence such as machine learning to new amounts of data that goes past what is captured </br>
            in standard databases. Companies like Google and IBM are Big Data companies with robots like IBM’s Watson as a big data product. Big Data is a great source</br>
            to improve decision-making. Big Data has been known as the breakthrough in Commerce, Science, and Society. Big Data is more about new insights rather than data.</p>

        <p class="indiv3">
            My response: I never knew what Big Data was until I attended college and I am glad that I have informed what it is and how it is used in society. Big Data is probably a good investment since the government as put so much money into doing research on it. Many tech companies use big data to create robots and capture data that a database cannot. I think is good to know that big data is often used for decision-making because a company will know what concept to use when making certain decisions in their workplace. Also, it is interesting to know that deals more with insights rather than the data itself.

        <b>Brain Computer Interface Advance Allows Fast and Accurate Typing By People With Paralysis</b>
        <p class="indiv4">
            The use of Brain Computer Interface has been a great influence on people with paralysis.  Advances in technology allowed three people who have movement impairments to control the cursor of a computer by imagining that their hands were moving. This form of technology has helped people with paralysis to type through direct brain control. After being trained, the participants in this survey were able to outperform the results of any brain computer interface being done previously. One participant was able to type 39 characters per minute. Amazing right? How does it all work? They each had baby-aspirin-sized electrode arrays placed in their brains to record signals from the engine cortex, an area controlling muscle development. These signs were transmitted to a PC by means of a link and made an interpretation by calculations into point-and-snap charges managing a cursor to characters on an onscreen console. Based on the success of this study, researchers are looking into using brain computer interface for other impairments.

        </p>
        <p>
            My response: I think the idea of using brain computer interface as a way to help people with paralysis is brilliant. The results of this study alone proves that BCI will be beneficial to the health field. In addition, I think having this form of technology will help boost the confidence of the people living with impairments. I was amazed when I read that one participant was able to type 39 characters per minute. Whoever proposed this idea did a great deed to society.

        <b>The Internet of Things Is Far Bigger Than Anyone Realizes</b>
        <p class="indiv4">
            Internet of things is the basis of machine-to-machine communication. The Internet of Things was created on cloud computing. Using cloud-based applications is a great way to implement data. The Internet of Things cannot function without having cloud-based applications to interpret and transmit the data coming from all the sensors. Sensors are used to track data in all aspects of life including engineering.  Internet of Things can influence the creation of new products and implement new services. One of the biggest technology trends is Internet of Things.

        </p>

        <p class="indiv4">
            My response: It is amazing how cloud computing plays a pivotal role in the implementation of the internet of things. The internet of things depends solely on cloud computing. The sensors have influence many things in society such as the recreation of a bridge that collapsed in Minnesota killing many people. Also, the internet of things will help lead to many new creations.
